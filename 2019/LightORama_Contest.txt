2019 Christmas Lights (Avicii Without You AFISHAL Remix)

My first full house light display using a Light-O-Rama controller.
It took a lot of work this year to get all the lights working and I had to learn how to use Light-O-Rama software. Next year should be much bigger and I hope to have 2 controllers running! 

ps. (3 sections of lights burnt out this year and I hope to have a more robust display next year).

Thanks for watching

This was my first year creating an outdoor christmas light display synced to music. I had a small budget (since I am a college student) and was lucky to grab a 16 channel controller from the spring super sale. I was surprised on how simple and reliable the light-o-rama software and controller was compared to other controllers on the market or attempting the DIY path.

Even though some lights burnt out (due to capacitor light strands ) many people around my neighborhood enjoyed the show.

I am planning to add pixel lights, trees, and arches next year!
